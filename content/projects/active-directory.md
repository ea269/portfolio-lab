## Overview (In Progress)

This project is currently under development. I am documenting the process of building a virtualized enterprise environment to simulate real-world identity management and security scenarios.

## Project Scope
Once completed, this lab will feature:
* **Domain Controller Setup:** Deploying Windows Server 2022 on Proxmox.
* **User & Group Management:** Implementing the principle of least privilege through refined Organizational Units (OUs).
* **Group Policy Objects (GPOs):** Automated hardening of workstation configurations.
* **Security Monitoring:** Integrating logs into a Splunk instance for threat detection.
